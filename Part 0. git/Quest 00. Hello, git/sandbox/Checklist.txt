Q1. Why is a VCS necessary?
A1. A VCS is necessary to keep historical data on files. It is useful for 
comparing a previous state to a current state or to revert back to previous
states, or to track issues by looking back at when modifications were made.
It is also useful to recover lost, corrupted, or deleted files. 
A VCS is also used to enable colloboration as it allows users to all work 
on the same project/file simultaneously.

Q2. What are other VCSs other than git? What are some differences and advantages?
Other VCSs are Mercurial (Hg), Subversion (Svn), and Team Foundation Server (TFS).
git:
    advantages: Fast performance, Distributed system (not reliant on connection to server), branches

Mercurial (DVCS):
    advantages: Better Windows support. Also is a DVCS like git. More intiutive than git ()
    differences: Fast, but not as fast as git. Simpliefied but less robust than git

Subversion (CVCS):
    advantages: Centralized, more protected codebase
    differences: Centralized, so users need network access to push/pull and to commit changes. 
    Merging is difficult (when two developers are working on the same file)
    Slower than git

TFS:
    advantages: Microsoft
    differences: Microsoft
