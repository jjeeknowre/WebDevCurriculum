 Check what TCP packets are coming in on Wireshark when making a request to www.google.com.
 What is the process of sending/receiving TCP packets? What information is contained in these 
 packets?
 First, a SYN (synchronize) packet is sent from host device to google. Then google responds with
 an SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowldgement) packet to establish the connection.
 During the session, multiple ACK (acknowledgement) packets are sent between the host device and google.
 When the session is terminated, the host sends a FIN (finish) packet, and google sends a RST (reset) packet
 to close the connection. (some servers may send a FIN-ACK packet response)

 Send an HTTP request to http://www.google.com/ via the telnet command.
 What headers are there? What do the headers do?
