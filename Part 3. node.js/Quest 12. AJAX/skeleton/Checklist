Q1. What do we do when we do not know when Javascript code inside of
user events, methods, HTTP requests, are executed?
A1. <unsure of this answer>

Q2. What is the browser's XMLhttpRequest object, and how does it work?
A2. The XMLHttpRequest object allows the browser to interact with servers
without requiring the browser to do a full page refresh. This enables a 
Web page to update without interrupting what the user is doing on the page.
It supports other data types besides XML, and also supports other protocols
such as ftp. 

Q3. What is the fetch API, and how does it work?
A3. The fetch API is a promised based HTTP request API. 
The fetch method takes one required argument, the path/address to the
resource that the browser is trying to access. It then returns a Promise
object which signifies either a success or failure to get the resource.
When a response is retrieved, methods like 'then' and 'catch' can be 
called to handle the data from the server.
