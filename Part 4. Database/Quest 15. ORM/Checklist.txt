Q1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an ORM than not using one?
A1. Advantages: ORM's reduce the amount of code needed to be written, and makes code 
easier to read by not requiring the use of SQL code (for the most part). 
Disadvantages: designing a database around an ORM sometime results in poor database design. 
It is not always possible to match a relational database to an object system. Might be slow
when doing complicated queries. Javascript relates data using objects, whereas databases link
them using foreign keys.

Q2. What are the 1:1, 1:N, and N:M reationships between models and when do you use them?
A2. 1:1 refers to a one to one relationship when one occurrence of an entry in a database
relates to only one occurence of another.
1:N refers to a one to many relationship, where one occurence relates to many others in a database
M:N refers to a many to many relationsip where entities on both sides of the relationship can relate
to more than one (on the other side).
These relationships are used for database design on design how tables relate to each other
