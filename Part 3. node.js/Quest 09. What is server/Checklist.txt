into a form that the application data can accept
5. Session - the layer that creates a session between two devices and facilitates
the connection between two devices
4. Transport - Provides transfer of data between two devices and is responsible
for that data to be received completely
3. Network - The layer that routers and switches work out of (IP addresses)
Responsible for addressing, error handling, congestion, and packet control
2. Datalink - The layer that corresponds to the delivery of data at the same level
of a network
1. Physical - The literal physical objects that link the devices together

Q2. When we type in the domain www.knowre.com, how do we get Knowre's 
server address?

Domain Name Server (DNS). The DNS then supplies the server address to our 
device.
