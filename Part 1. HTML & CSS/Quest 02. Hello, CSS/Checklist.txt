Q1. What are advantages and disadvantages of the three ways of applying CSS to HTML?

Q2. If multiple CCS rules are applied, which one takes precedence?
A2. Specificity takes precedence in CSS. If two or more rules have the same level of 
specificity on an element, then whichever CSS rule comes last (in the css file/html file),
that rule takes precedence


Q3. If a box has the attribute "position: absolute", where is the anchor point?
A3. If an element has the attribute "position: absolute", the element is positioned
relative to the closest positioned ancestor (parent/grandparent, etc) element (ancestor
should be position: relative or position: absolute).

Q4. How do you fill a box which is variable sized, and the other fixed sized. (?)
A4. I do not know how to do this. My guess would be to make a container with the two child elements,
and then to make the parent element to be sized according to the child element with a fixed size.
Then set the variable-sized child element to be sized according to the parent element. I could not
find a way to implement this, however.

Q5. Why is the float property not good?
A5. Floats were never intended to be used for website layout design. Floats also add unncessary complications
to CSS layouts, as well as unpredictability in the layout. It's biggest problem is that the float element
is removed from the normal flow of the document.

Q6. What are the pros and cons of Flexbox and grid?
