    to be available for use for other modules to use.
    Q1b. How do `module.exports` and `exports` differ?
    A1b. We can think of `module.exports` as the variable that gets returned from `require`
    and `exports` as a reference to `module.exports` as an convenience variable

node.js. No node.js is required. It makes it easier for developers to share and use code.
    Q2a. How is it different when using -g (Global) on npm packages?
